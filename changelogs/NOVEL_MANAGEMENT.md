# Novel Management Feature

## Overview

Added comprehensive novel management functionality to the hi-elysia
application, following the established patterns and architecture.

## Implementation Date

June 14, 2025

## Features Added

### 1. Novel Repository Layer (`src/features/novels/repositories/novel.repository.ts`)

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and soft delete novels
- **Advanced Queries**:
  - Pagination support with limit/offset
  - Filtering by author, status, search term, categories, and tags
  - Sorting by various fields (creation date, title, views, rating)
  - Full-text search in title and description
- **Relationship Management**:
  - Category association (many-to-many)
  - Tag association (many-to-many)
  - Author relationship (many-to-one)
- **Utility Functions**:
  - View count increment
  - Chapter count updates
  - Rating updates

### 2. Novel Service Layer (`src/features/novels/services/novel.service.ts`)

- **Business Logic**: Orchestrates repository operations with additional
  business rules
- **Data Enrichment**: Automatically fetches and includes categories, tags,
  and author information
- **Specialized Queries**:
  - `getPopularNovels()` - sorted by view count
  - `getTopRatedNovels()` - sorted by average rating
  - `getRecentNovels()` - sorted by creation date
  - `getRecentlyUpdatedNovels()` - sorted by update date
  - `searchNovels()` - full-text search with filters
  - `getNovelsByAuthor()` - author-specific novels
- **Pagination**: Consistent pagination with metadata (total pages, has next/prev)

### 3. Novel Controller Layer (`src/features/novels/controllers/novel.controller.ts`)

- **RESTful API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /novels` - List novels with filtering, sorting, and pagination
  - `GET /novels/:id` - Get single novel with metadata
  - `POST /novels` - Create new novel with categories and tags
  - `PUT /novels/:id` - Update novel information
  - `DELETE /novels/:id` - Soft delete novel
- **Specialized Endpoints**:
  - `GET /novels/popular` - Popular novels by views
  - `GET /novels/top-rated` - Top rated novels
  - `GET /novels/recent` - Recently created novels
  - `GET /novels/recently-updated` - Recently updated novels
  - `GET /novels/author/:authorId` - Novels by specific author
  - `GET /novels/search/:searchTerm` - Search novels
- **Request Validation**: Comprehensive input validation using Elysia's type system
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### 4. Database Integration

- **Leveraged Existing Schema**: Used the comprehensive novel schema already
  defined in `src/db/schema.ts`
- **Relationship Support**: Full support for novel-category and novel-tag
  many-to-many relationships
- **Soft Delete**: Implemented soft delete pattern consistent with the existing codebase

## API Endpoints

### Core Novel Operations

```http
GET    /novels                    # List novels with filters
GET    /novels/:id                # Get novel by ID
POST   /novels                    # Create novel
PUT    /novels/:id                # Update novel
DELETE /novels/:id                # Delete novel
```

### Discovery Endpoints

```http
GET    /novels/popular             # Popular novels
GET    /novels/top-rated           # Top rated novels
GET    /novels/recent              # Recently created
GET    /novels/recently-updated    # Recently updated
```

### Search and Filter

```http
GET    /novels/author/:authorId    # Novels by author
GET    /novels/search/:searchTerm  # Search novels
```

### Query Parameters

- `page` - Page number for pagination
- `limit` - Items per page
- `authorId` - Filter by author
- `status` - Filter by status (ongoing, completed, hiatus, dropped)
- `search` - Search in title and description
- `sortBy` - Sort field (createdAt, updatedAt, title, averageRating, totalViews)
- `sortOrder` - Sort direction (asc, desc)
- `categoryIds` - Filter by categories (comma-separated)
- `tagIds` - Filter by tags (comma-separated)

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- **Repository Tests**: 10 test cases covering all repository methods
- **Service Tests**: 10 test cases covering business logic and data orchestration
- **Controller Tests**: 12 test cases covering all API endpoints and validation

### Test Results

- All repository tests: ✅ PASSED (10/10)
- All service tests: ✅ PASSED (10/10)
- All controller tests: ✅ PASSED (12/12)

### Test Categories

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Filtering and Search**: Various query combinations
- **Pagination**: Page-based navigation
- **Relationships**: Category and tag associations
- **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs and edge cases
- **HTTP Integration**: Full API request/response testing

## Integration

### Application Registration

- Added novel controller to main application in `src/index.ts`
- Exported novel feature in `src/features/index.ts`
- Included proper barrel exports in `src/features/novels/index.ts`

### Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ ESLint validation: No warnings or errors
- ✅ Prettier formatting: Applied and verified
- ✅ All tests passing: 32/32 test cases

## Architecture Compliance

The novel management feature follows the established architecture patterns:

1. **Three-Layer Architecture**: Repository → Service → Controller
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services use repository instances
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with Drizzle ORM
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and HTTP status codes
5. **Validation**: Request validation using Elysia's type system
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all layers

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for additional features:

1. **Chapter Management**: Integration with the existing chapter schema
2. **Review System**: Rating and review functionality
3. **User Favorites**: Reading lists and bookmarks
4. **Analytics**: View tracking and reading statistics
5. **Content Moderation**: Flagging and review systems
6. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with indexing
7. **Caching**: Redis integration for popular queries

## Database Schema Utilized

The implementation leverages these existing tables:

- `novels` - Core novel information
- `novel_categories` - Novel-category relationships
- `novel_tags` - Novel-tag relationships
- `categories` - Genre/category definitions
- `tags` - Tag definitions
- `users` - Author information
- `chapters` - Chapter content (for counts)

## Performance Considerations

- **Pagination**: Limit queries to prevent performance issues
- **Lazy Loading**: Categories and tags fetched separately when needed
- **Indexing**: Leverages database indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Filtering**: SQL-level filtering to minimize data transfer
- **Soft Deletes**: Maintains data integrity while hiding deleted content

The novel management system is now fully operational and ready for production use.
