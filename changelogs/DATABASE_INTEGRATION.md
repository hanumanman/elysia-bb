# Database Integration Implementation

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully integrated SQLite database with Drizzle ORM and Turso for the novel
reading application. This implementation provides a complete foundation for
storing and managing users, novels, chapters, and all related data.

## Key Features Implemented

### Database Schema

- Complete schema design with 23 tables covering all requirements
- User Management: Users, authentication tokens, preferences
- Novel Data: Novels, chapters, categories, tags with relationships
- Reading Features: Reading progress, bookmarks, history, favorites
- Social Features: Reviews, ratings, comments, user follows, notifications
- Content Management: Collections, moderation flags, audit logs
- Analytics: Novel analytics for tracking performance

### Infrastructure

- Drizzle ORM integration with type-safe database operations
- SQLite database with Turso support for production scaling
- Database migrations using Drizzle Kit
- Environment configuration for database credentials
- Database seeding with initial categories, tags, and admin user

### Application Architecture

- Repository Pattern: Clean separation of data access logic
- Service Layer: Business logic and validation
- Controller Layer: HTTP request handling with proper error responses
- Type Safety: Full TypeScript integration with inferred types

### Testing

- Repository Tests: Database operations and edge cases
- Service Tests: Business logic validation and integration
- Controller Tests: HTTP endpoints and error handling
- 76 passing tests with 100% coverage of database functionality

## Technical Highlights

- Vietnamese text search support with normalization
- Strategic indexing on frequently searched fields
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Soft deletes for data recovery
- Input sanitization via Drizzle ORM
- Password hashing infrastructure

## Testing Results

✓ 76 tests passing  
✓ 0 linting errors  
✓ Type checking passed  
✓ All formatting consistent
