# Notes Route Removal

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Type:** Cleanup/Removal  
**Impact:** Breaking Change for Notes API

## Summary

Removed the notes route and all related files as it was a test route that
doesn't relate to our app's core functionality.

## Changes Made

### Removed Files

- `src/features/notes/` - Entire notes feature directory including:

  - `controllers/note.controller.ts`
  - `models/note.models.ts`
  - `repositories/note.repository.ts`
  - `services/note.service.ts`
  - `types/note.types.ts`
  - `index.ts`

- `tests/features/notes/` - Entire notes test directory including:
  - `note.controller.test.ts`
  - `note.repository.test.ts`
  - `note.service.test.ts`

### Modified Files

- `src/index.ts` - Removed `noteController` import and usage
- `src/features/index.ts` - Removed `noteController` export
- `tests/app.integration.test.ts` - Removed all note-related integration tests
- `tests/test-utils.ts` - Removed note-related test data

## API Changes

### Removed Endpoints

- `GET /notes` - Get all notes
- `POST /notes` - Create a new note
- `GET /notes/:id` - Get note by ID
- `PUT /notes/:id` - Update note by ID
- `DELETE /notes/:id` - Delete note by ID

## Testing

All remaining tests pass successfully:

- Health controller tests ✓
- User controller tests ✓
- User service tests ✓
- User repository tests ✓
- Response service tests ✓
- Integration tests ✓

## Technical Details

- No database schema changes were required (notes used in-memory storage)
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Linting passes without warnings
- Application starts and runs successfully
- Swagger documentation automatically updated

## Rationale

The notes functionality was implemented as a test/example feature and doesn't
align with the core application requirements. Removing it simplifies the
codebase and focuses development on the actual business features (user
management and the novel platform functionality).
